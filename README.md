# HydraCore3
Modern rendering core: spec, vulkan (by kernel_slicer) and other

## Build (CPU)
1) clone this repo with all its submodules
   
   ```markdown 
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ray-Tracing-Systems/HydraCore3.git
   ```

   or use

   ```markdown
   git clone https://github.com/Ray-Tracing-Systems/HydraCore3.git
   git submodule init && git submodule update
   ```

2) Disable Vulkan by '-DUSE_VULKAN=OFF'
3) Build normally with Cmake 

## Build (CPU and GPU) [Linux only for now]
1) clone https://github.com/Ray-Tracing-Systems/kernel_slicer
2) Build kernel_slicer
3) clone this repo with all its submodules

   ```markdown
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ray-Tracing-Systems/HydraCore3.git
   ```

   or use

   ```markdown
   git clone https://github.com/Ray-Tracing-Systems/HydraCore3.git
   git submodule init && git submodule update
   ```

4) run kernel_slicer with 'Launch (HydraCore3/GLSL/External)' config
5) build shaders (by calling 'shaders_generated/build.sh')
6) build solution normally with CMake

## Development pipeline
1) Select/Find/Make a reference image to you feature
2) Implement it in renderer on CPU
3) run kernel_slicer to get GPU version and be sure that code succesefully transformed to shaders
   * you may work with CPU build only, but this is long ...  
4) Add test to python script 'testing/run_tests.py':
   * You have to clone https://github.com/Ray-Tracing-Systems/HydraAPI-tests
   * You have to run tests from 'HydraAPI-tests' repo to generate scene files
   * If you don't have access to some closed test repo which is used in test, please comment out such tests. Otherwise clone these repos.
   * Currently you have to set two variables in script: 'PATH_TO_HYDRA2_TESTS' and 'PATH_TO_HYDRA3_SCENS' (the last one is currently closed)
   * read [testing script doc](testing/testing_doc.md)
5) Add you feature to specitication in specification: 'HydraAPI-tests/doc/doc_hydra_standart/hydra_spec.tex'
